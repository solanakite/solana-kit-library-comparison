# Solana TypeScript Library Comparison

This repository compares different Solana TypeScript libraries by implementing the same simple task: creating a wallet on devnet, airdropping 1 SOL to it, and sending a memo transaction.

The example was originally taken from the https://www.gillsdk.com/api/gill and adapted for comparison across different libraries.

## Libraries Compared

- [Solana Kit](https://solanakit.com)
- [Solana Kite](https://solanakite.org)
- [Gill](https://www.gillsdk.com)
- [Framework Kit](https://github.com/solana-foundation/framework-kit)
- [Metaplex Umi](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/umi)
- [web3.js v1](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)

## Running the Examples

```bash
npx tsx kite.ts
npx tsx gill.ts
npx tsx kit.ts
npx tsx framework-kit.ts
npx tsx umi.ts
npx tsx web3js.ts
```

## Testing Methodology

Code complexity is measured by counting programming tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, punctuation) while excluding comments and whitespace. Token counting is performed using the TypeScript Compiler API.

## Token Counting

```bash
npx tsx count-tokens.ts
```

## Results

Run `npx tsx count-tokens.ts` to see the results. As of 2026 01 05, they are:

```
=== Token Count Results ===

kite.ts                79 tokens
framework-kit.ts       99 tokens (25.3% more code)
web3js.ts             145 tokens (83.5% more code)
gill.ts               157 tokens (98.7% more code)
umi.ts                182 tokens (130.4% more code)
kit.ts                251 tokens (217.7% more code)
```
