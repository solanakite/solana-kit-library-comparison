# Solana TypeScript Library Comparison

This repository compares different Solana TypeScript libraries by implementing the same simple task: creating a wallet on devnet, airdropping 1 SOL to it, and sending a memo transaction.

The example was originally taken from the https://www.gillsdk.com/api/gill and adapted for comparison across different libraries.

Code complexity is measured by counting programming tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, literals, punctuation) while excluding comments and whitespace. Token counting is performed using the TypeScript Compiler API.

## Libraries Compared

- [Solana Kit](https://solanakit.com)
- [Solana Kite](https://solanakite.org)
- [Gill](https://www.gillsdk.com)
- [Framework Kit](https://github.com/solana-foundation/framework-kit)
- [Metaplex Umi](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/umi)
- [web3.js v1](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/)
- [web3.js v1 with @solana-developers/helpers](https://github.com/solana-developers/helpers)

## Token Counting

```bash
npx tsx count-tokens.ts
```

## Results

Run `npx tsx count-tokens.ts` to see the results. As of 2026 01 09, they are:

=== Token Count Results ===

Kite                        79 tokens
Framework Kit              99 tokens (25.3% more code)
web3.js v1 + helpers       122 tokens (54.4% more code)
web3.js v1                 145 tokens (83.5% more code)
Gill                       157 tokens (98.7% more code)
Umi                        182 tokens (130.4% more code)
